//TODO look for a way to do this without the reverse
//TODO find proper design patterns for the generator

-finished the ExtractData method
-added utility methods to ParseBytesExtensions.cs
-changed the type in MessageBase to object type so there won't be conflict between enums(probably not a good idea, read to find a new way)
-bypassed the need the match the enums by doing what is written above
-entered the class type in the ctor declaration
-used in IEnumerable instead of byte array in Generate.cs
