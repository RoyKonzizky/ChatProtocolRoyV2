//TODO find proper design patterns for the generator

//TODO add start index and end index in IChecksumCalculator(because int is 4 bytes but only two are for checksum), 
    make a class of constants for indexes
    
//TODO might have to create different generators and parsers for each type

//TODO change the packet from a class to concept(its just an array of bytes)


//maybe add length to packet to know the size of the string(the message itself) before parsing 
//maybe different builders for each type

//when it comes to git, every module gets it's own branch

-implemented builder interfaces
