//TODO look for a way to do this without the reverse or find a way to force the Message types to only contain 15 bytes

//TODO find proper design patterns for the generator

//TODO add start index and index in IChecksumCalculator and make a class of constants for indexes-would probably help with the first TODO

//TODO define size for each part of the packet

//TODO might have to create different generators and parsers for each type, 
    change the packet from a class to concept(its just an array of bytes), 
    add length to packet to know the size of the string(the message itself) before parsing, 
    add the type to the string so i know how to parse it,
    probably need to parse individual parts of the message because unless it fits perfectly,
    maybe different builders for each type,
    need to find a way to change the object in MessageBase to a concrete type

-did code cleanup
-added TODOs and comments that should get a second look
