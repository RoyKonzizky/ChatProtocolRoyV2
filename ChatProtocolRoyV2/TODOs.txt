//TODO look for a way to do this without the reverse
//TODO finish the ExtractData method



-changed the IParse.cs type into MessageBase instead of Packet
-added methods that pull the sync, tail and checksum and the parser validates the checksums
-IEnumerable instead of byte array in Generate.cs and why its better
-Packet fields type and guid have been removed because those are already contained within the data
