//TODO create FileType Enum



//parser is the reverse process of the generator


-rework the parser class according to the following principle: since te packet has T Data property, it receives a 
messageBase object, so in order to get specific parts of each object(i.e. the fileName and dateOfCreation i need to take 
it apart by it's fields(probably by size)-done
-added a method to generate the packet
-reworked the builder
-added better checksum and it's types are consistent across the code
