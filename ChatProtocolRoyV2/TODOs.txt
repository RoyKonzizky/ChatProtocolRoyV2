//TODO find proper design patterns for the generator

//TODO add start index and index in IChecksumCalculator(because int is 4 bytes but only two are for checksum), 
    make a class of constants for indexes
    
//TODO might have to create different generators and parsers for each type, 
    change the packet from a class to concept(its just an array of bytes), 
    add length to packet to know the size of the string(the message itself) before parsing, 
    add the type to the string so i know how to parse and build it,
    maybe different builders for each type,
    need to find a way to change the object in MessageBase to a concrete type


-did the ExtractChecksum method without reversing
-organized the directories
