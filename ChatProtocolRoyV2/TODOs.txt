//parser is the reverse process of the generator
//TODO: create a method to generate the packet, interface to generate what is needed
//TODO: expand the packet so the parser won't deal with low-level code, so instead of dealing with magic bytes it will get the type of file
//TODO rework this section in Parse.cs to work with different MessageTypes
//TODO better checksum needed(done) and make sure it's types are correct and consistent
//TODO rework the parser class according to the following principle: since te packet has T Data property, it receives a messageBase object, so in order to get specific parts of each object(i.e. the fileName and dateOfCreation i need to take it apart by it's fields(probably by size)
